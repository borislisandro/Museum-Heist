# Master Thief Project

The Master Thief project simulates a heist scenario involving multiple entities, including a master thief and several ordinary thieves, working together to execute a coordinated heist. This system is developed using Java and leverages multi-threading and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) for communication between different components running on separate machines.
