Museum heist project simulates a heist scenario where multiple entities, including a master thief and several ordinary thieves, interact to execute a coordinated heist. The system is designed using Java and leverages multi-threading to simulate the concurrent actions of the thieves. The different entities communicate over a network using Remote Method Invocation (RMI), ensuring distributed coordination.
